# The-Integrated-Library-Management-System
This is  the Python Project on The Library Management System
This program creates a Library class and a Customer class. The Library class has methods for displaying available books, lending a book, and adding a book. The Customer class has methods for requesting a book and returning a book.

The program creates an instance of the Library class with an initial list of books, and an instance of the Customer class. It then displays a menu with four options: displaying available books, requesting a book, returning a book, and exiting. Depending on the user's choice, the program calls the appropriate method of the Library or Customer class.

Note that this is just a sample program and there are many ways to implement a library management system in Python. This program can be improved and expanded to include more features, such as checking the status of borrowed books, keeping track of due dates, and so on.
